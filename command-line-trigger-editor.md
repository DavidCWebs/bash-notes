# Trigger an Editor Session to Edit a Command in BASH

If you are entering a command on the BASH prompt, you can trigger a text editor session that:

* Opens the command in your default text editor
* Runs the possibly edited command when you save and close the file

This is really useful but I often forget the required keystrokes for some reason. Here they are:

```bash
Ctrl-x
(Keep holding Ctrl)
Ctrl-e
``` 
Think of the sequence as: "e*x*it the command line and use the *e*ditor".

This will allow you to search and replace in the command - basically use all the efficiencies that you gain from using a text editor.
